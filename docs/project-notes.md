# Notes taken during the project

1. FileNotFoundError - occurs when a file or directory doesn't exist. Ended up using the example provided by Real Python(2025) and applied it to my code in parse.py

2. Creating a CSV File using Python - done by importing the 'csv' module and defining its path & data, helped me establish the file 'alerts.csv' if there was no such file created yet.

3. Creating a new folder =  You import the 'os' module and use os.mkdir() method to create the folder. This method and the example provided by freeCodeCamp.org (2023), where they used the try/except method to create the new folder if it doesn't exist, was applied to my code.

4. Parsing logs - Done by importing the 're' module and providing a log_pattern (GeeksforGeeks, 2024). I did unfortunetly struggle to apply this because this was a new concept for me, especially the log patterns that need to be applied because they have complicated signs to be defined. 
The ChatGPT chat that provided instructions like a unicersity course did apply the log patterns for me and gave me extra hints such as ".writeheader()" & "csv.dictWriter" methods. I did try my best to use these hints to write up the code, which was executed but not as efficiently.

5. explain your code vs my code later
